      " From fairest creatures we desire increase, That thereby beautyâ€™s rose might never die, But as the riper should by time decease, His tender heir might bear his memory: But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes, Feedâ€™st thy lightâ€™s flame with self-substantial fuel, Making a famine where abundance lies, Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel: Thou that art now the worldâ€™s fresh ornament, And only herald to the gaudy spring, Within thine own bud buriest thy content, And, tender churl, makâ€™st waste in niggarding: Pity the world, or else this glutton be, To eat the worldâ€™s due, by the grave and thee.  \n",

      " When forty winters shall besiege thy brow, And dig deep trenches in thy beautyâ€™s field, Thy youthâ€™s proud livery so gazed on now, Will be a tattered weed of small worth held: Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies, Where all the treasure of thy lusty days; To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes, Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise. How much more praise deservâ€™d thy beautyâ€™s use, If thou couldst answer â€˜This fair child of mine Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,â€™ Proving his beauty by succession thine.

Thou art thy motherâ€™s glass and she in thee Calls back the lovely April of her prime, So thou through windows of thine age shalt see, Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.

Profitless usurer why dost thou use So great a sum of sums yet canst not live? For having traffic with thy self alone, Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive, Then how when nature calls thee to be gone, What acceptable audit canst thou leave? Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee, Which used lives thâ€™ executor to be.  \n",

But flowers distilled though they with winter meet, Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet.  \n",

      " O that you were your self, but love you are No longer yours, than you your self here live, Against this coming end you should prepare, And your sweet semblance to some other give. So should that beauty which you hold in lease Find no determination, then you were Your self again after your selfâ€™s decease, When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear. Who lets so fair a house fall to decay, Which husbandry in honour might uphold, Against the stormy gusts of winterâ€™s day And barren rage of deathâ€™s eternal cold? O none but unthrifts, dear my love you know, You had a father, let your son say so.  \n",

      " A womanâ€™s face with natureâ€™s own hand painted, Hast thou the master mistress of my passion, A womanâ€™s gentle heart but not acquainted With shifting change as is false womenâ€™s fashion, An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling: Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth, A man in hue all hues in his controlling, Which steals menâ€™s eyes and womenâ€™s souls amazeth. And for a woman wert thou first created, Till nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting, And by addition me of thee defeated, By adding one thing to my purpose nothing. But since she pricked thee out for womenâ€™s pleasure, Mine be thy love and thy loveâ€™s use their treasure.  \n",

      " Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend, Upon thy self thy beautyâ€™s legacy? Natureâ€™s bequest gives nothing but doth lend, And being frank she lends to those are free: Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse, The bounteous largess given thee to give? Profitless usurer why dost thou use So great a sum of sums yet canst not live? For having traffic with thy self alone, Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive, Then how when nature calls thee to be gone, What acceptable audit canst thou leave? Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee, Which used lives thâ€™ executor to be.  \n",

      " How can I then return in happy plight That am debarred the benefit of rest? When dayâ€™s oppression is not eased by night, But day by night and night by day oppressed. And each (though enemies to eitherâ€™s reign) Do in consent shake hands to torture me, The one by toil, the other to complain How far I toil, still farther off from thee. I tell the day to please him thou art bright, And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven: So flatter I the swart-complexioned night, When sparkling stars twire not thou gildâ€™st the even. But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer, And night doth nightly make griefâ€™s length seem stronger  \n",

      " Music to hear, why hearâ€™st thou music sadly? Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy: Why lovâ€™st thou that which thou receivâ€™st not gladly, Or else receivâ€™st with pleasure thine annoy? If the true concord of well-tuned sounds, By unions married do offend thine ear, They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear: Mark how one string sweet husband to another, Strikes each in each by mutual ordering; Resembling sire, and child, and happy mother, Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing: Whose speechless song being many, seeming one, Sings this to thee, â€˜Thou single wilt prove noneâ€™.  \n",

      " Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war, How to divide the conquest of thy sight, Mine eye, my heart thy pictureâ€™s sight would bar, My heart, mine eye the freedom of that right, My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie, (A closet never pierced with crystal eyes) But the defendant doth that plea deny, And says in him thy fair appearance lies. To side this title is impanelled A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart, And by their verdict is determined The clear eyeâ€™s moiety, and the dear heartâ€™s part. As thus, mine eyeâ€™s due is thy outward part, And my heartâ€™s right, thy inward love of heart.  \n",

      " Those hours that with gentle work did frame The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell Will play the tyrants to the very same, And that unfair which fairly doth excel: For never-resting time leads summer on To hideous winter and confounds him there, Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone, Beauty oâ€™er-snowed and bareness every where: Then were not summerâ€™s distillation left A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass, Beautyâ€™s effect with beauty were bereft, Nor it nor no remembrance what it was. But flowers distilled though they with winter meet, Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet.  \n",
